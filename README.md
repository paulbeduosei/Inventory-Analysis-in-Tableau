# Inventory-Analysis-in-Tableau
Just finished my latest Tableau project analyzing inventory performance by category and country 🌎📊 The goal: find which products deserve restocking or expansion. ✅ Key insight: Class A items have 3x more stock but only slightly faster turnover than Class B. 💡 Recommendation: Increase Class B inventory for a better stock-to-turnover balance!
